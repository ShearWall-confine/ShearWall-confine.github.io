    <p>    
        This site provides the results of over 400 cyclic, lateral-load tests of reinforced concrete columns. The database describes tests of:
        <ul>
            <li>spiral or circular hoop-reinforced columns (with circular, octagonal or rectangular cross-sections)
            <li>rectangular reinforced columns
            <li>columns with or without splices
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    For each test where the information is available, the database provides the:
    
    <ul>
        <li>column geometry
        <li>column material properties
        <li>column reinforcing details
        <li>test configuration (including P-delta configuration)
        <li>axial load
        <li>digital force-displacement history at the top of the column
        <li>top displacement that preceded various damage observations
        <li>key drawings and images (where available)
        <li>comments (e.g., unusual characteristics)
        <li>references and links for further information
    </ul>
    </p>

    The core of the database was assembled by researchers at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST), who collected data for 92 test of columns with circular spiral or hoop-reinforced columns and 107 tests of columns with rectangular reinforcement. For each test, the NIST database described the reported test geometry, material properties, top force-displacement histories and a reference. Dr. Andrew Taylor, formerly of NIST, provided invaluable assistance in developing the database.

    The column data was collected and processed by University of Washington students Michael Berry, Haili Camarillo, Amit Mookerjee, Myles Parrish, and Zachary Price. Mr. Berry and Mr. Price were supported by the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates Program.
